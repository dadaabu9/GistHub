     <p><h3>Baby crow:</h3> (Fledgling; Nestling) A fledgling crow in a dream represents poverty,
need, separation from one's parents and segregation from one'srelatives or clan.
If one is experiencing such adverse conditions in wakefulness, then seeing a
fledgling crow in a dream means satisfaction of one's needs and reunion with
his family. When the egg hatches and the baby crow comes out of it, the parents
shy away from their fledgling and remain distant from the nest. Then God
Almighty will provide the nestling crow with various types of flies to eat from.
Once the baby crow's feathers grow, the parents will return to their nest and
care for their baby until it commences to fly.</p>


<p><h3>Back:</h3>(Behind; Posterior; Rear side) In a dream, the back of a human being
represents what people hold for him of praises or blame, acceptance or rejection,
honor or humiliation, or it could represents one's debts. Seeing the back of a
human being in a dream also means following his tracks or practices. If a
positive look manifests therein, such as a sweet fragrance or the emergence of
a radiant light, or if it turns into iron in the dream, it signifies one's gratitude
regarding his own condition. In a dream, the rear side of the human being
represents his outward appearance or what renders the human being acceptable, or it could represent his garment, an ostentatious person, a show of
grandeur, pride about one's social class, a show of being wealthy, the surroundings of one's house, the outskirts of a town, the outer display of one's religion
or his school of thought. A broken back in a dream means fear, distress and
sorrow. If one sees his rear side dark in color, black or red in a dream, it means
that he may suffer from physical abuse and beating during a fight. Seeing one's
own back in a dream also could mean buying new clothing, or it could mean
feeling strong because of one's knowledge, his son, power, political connections,
wealth or property. Seeing one's back in a dream also could mean to repudiate
one's wife. Ifone's back is seared or cauterized in a dream, it denotes stinginess,
or it could mean that he fails to comply with God's rights upon him. Ifone sees
his back bent in a dream, it means a misfortune. Ifone seesthe back of his friend
in a dream, it means that his friend will turn his back to him at times when he
needs him most. If one sees the back of his enemy in a dream, it means that he
will be guarded against his threats. If one sees the back of an old woman in a
dream, it means that the world is turning its back to him. Ifshe is in her middle
age in the dream, it means that he is seeking something hard to obtain. Ifshe
is a young woman in the dream, it means that he is expecting something and
must be patient to acquire it. One's back also represents old age. Back pain in
a dream means poverty, sickness, debility, imprisonment of one's boss or the
death of a brother. One's back in a dream also represents one's dependence on
a strong person. Ifone sees himselfcarrying a heavy load on his back in a dream,
it means debts, or a vicious neighbor. A broken back in a dream means losing
one's strength and power, or it could mean one's death. If a sick person sees his
back broken in a dream, it means that the person who is taking care of him may
die shortly, or it could mean that he will suffer from poverty. Carrying burden</p>
