means his dismissal from his office or his death. Seeing that dream after a
wedding or after having marital relations with one's wife means mistrust and
loss. It also means involvement in an uncouth action, lacking knowledge of the
Holy Book and prophetic traditions, because what one has built lacks a foundation. Flying in the air in a dream may mean travels. Flying with wings in a
dream has stronger connotations and is safer. The wings here will represent
money or power. Swimming in the air means benefits or business travels. Ifthe
air looks opaque in one's eyes, so he cannot see the skies in his dream, it means
problems with one's superior. Ifone does not have a boss, then it means that he
may lose his sight. If all the people witnessed the air opaque or red in the dream,
then it means a major calamity and a trying adversity. (Also see Ascending in
the Skies; Flying)</p>

Messenger, upon whom be peace.) Seeing him in a dream means victory over
one's enemy. Seeing him in a place Or a mosque where people are mourning him
or performing the funeral prayer on him or carrying his coffin or prostrating to

enemy, presiding over the believers, hardships duringtravels, booty, manifestation
of blessings and miracles, acquiring extraordinary knowledge, following the
leading practices of God's Messenger, upon whom be peace, or fulfillment of

a connection with the leadership of the land and profiting from it. Seeing him
with wounds over his body in a dream means that one will become subject to
people's slander and defamation.</p>

<p><h3>Allah:</h3> God Almighty, Lord, Creator and Cherisher of the universes. There is
nothing like unto Him and He is the All-Hearing, the Al-Seeing Lord. Seeing
Him in a dream can be interpreted according to one's state of being. Ifone sees
Him in His glory and majesty, without descriptive designation, without ascription of human characteristics to Him and without depiction or portrayal in the
dream, it is an indication of glad tidings for both this world and the hereafter. These blessings also may continue to affect the lives of one's progeny. Ifone sees
Him otherwise in a dream, it means confusion, and particularly if the Almighty
Lord does not address him. If an ailing person sees Him in a dream, it means
that he will soon die and come to meet Him. Ifa straying soul sees God Almighty
in a dream, it will find guidance. Ifan oppressed person sees Him, it means that
justice will prevail and he will triumph over his oppressors. HearingGod's words
without designation represents the imagination of the person in the dream.
Perhaps hearing His words in a dream appeases one's heart and increases the
person's drive for success. Hearing God's words without seeing Him represents
the rising of one's station. If one receives revelations from behind a veil in a
dream, it means mental confusion and innovation. This is most true if a
messenger comes in one's dream and describes the one who spoke as God. In this
case, the dream is a nightmare, because God Almighty cannot be depicted
according to human descriptions. If one sees a picture of God in his dream, it
means that he is a liar who ascribes images to God Almighty that do not befit
His Majesty and Glory. If one hears God Almighty talking to him directly and
if he can focus at Him in the dream, it means that he will be encompassed with
God's mercy and blessings. If one sees God Almighty in a dream, it means that
he will look at His Divine countenance in the hereafter. Seeing God Almighty
seated on the Divine Throne in a dream means elevation of one's rank,
knowledge and increase in his wealth. Ifone sees himself running away to hide
from God Almighty in a dream, it means that he will change the course of his
devotion into heedlessness. Seeing a veil separating between the servant and
his Lord in a dream means that one will commit major sins and abominable
actions. If one sees his Lord frowning at him, whereby he could not bear the
effulgence of God'slight, or ifhe is seized by a shock and immediately commences
to repent and pray for forgiveness in the dream, it means that such a person is
indulging in abominable actions, and that he is a despicable sinner who follows
his own mind and desires, and that he is an innovator of religious thoughts who
misleads the people. If one hears God Almighty talking to him in a dream, it
represents an admonition and a warning to abstain from sin. Ifone hears God
Almighty talking to him in a dream, it also means that one is more assiduous
in hisrecital ofthe Qur'iin. Ifone hears God Almighty talking to him with words
he cannot understand, then if He anoints him and blesses him in the dream, it
means that God Almighty will bringhim nigh unto Himselfand exalt hisstation.
If one sees God Almighty in a form resembling one's father, a brother or a
relative and showing His kindness or blessing him in a dream, it means that he
will be afflicted with a calamity and a major illness. If a righteous person sees
himself standing before God Almighty in reverence and filled with awe in a
dream, it means that mercy will encompass him and help him to further his
growth. The same interpretation applies if one sees himself prostrating before
Him. If God Almighty speaks to someone from behind a veil in a dream, it can
also represent a good worshipper, but if the Divine address takes place without
a veil in the dream, it means falling into sin. IfGod Almighty names someone
in his dream with his birth name, then adds another title to it, it means rising
in station and rank. If one sees God Almighty angry with him in a dream; it
means that his parents are displeased with him. This description includes
seeing oneselffalling from the skies or from the top of a mountain. If a devoted
servant sees God Almighty kissing him in a dream, it applies to his growing
devotion and reward. Fearing God Almighty in a dream reflects eminence,
peacefulness, quiescence, wealth of being and disregard for material needs.

receiving the blessing of performing one's obligatory prayers on time. Payment
ofone's due tithe also represents protection from one's enemies. Paying alms tax
in a dream also means performing supererogatory prayers during the night,
repayment of debts, absolution, or it could mean paying a fine. Alms tax in a
dream also means the death of a dear person in the family, or it could mean
losing a limb due to an illness or an accident, giving a charity for the benefit of
a departed soul, or payment of one's debts. Thus, paying alms tax in a dream
may mean increase in one's wealth, recovering from illness or payment of one's
debts, all of which earn levels of exaltation and blessings. To pay charity on one's
property of silver in a dream means begetting a son, or it could mean getting
married. Ifit is a poor person, then paying almstax in a dream represents God's
acceptance of one's deeds. If he is a sinner, it means that he will repent of sin
and earn lawful money, and if he is a disbeliever. it means that he will become
a believer. (Also see Charity; Endowment; Tithe collector)</p>
